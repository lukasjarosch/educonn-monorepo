# educonn.de
> An online learning platform - build to get better at microservices.

## API
The educonn APIs are specified using procotol buffers since we're using gRPC a lot.
Everything inside the `api` folder is managed using [prototool](https://github.com/uber/prototool) enforcing the [uber protobuf v2 style guide](https://github.com/uber/prototool/tree/dev/style).
